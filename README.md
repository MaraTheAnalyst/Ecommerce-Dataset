### Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing an Employee Attrition dataset to uncover insights about workforce demographics, salaries, departmental distributions, and attrition trends within the organization. The primary objective is to understand employee retention, salary variations, and workforce patterns that can inform strategic decisions in human resources management.

### Data Source
The primary dataset I used for this analysis is the **“HR_Employee_Attrition.xls”** file. It contains detailed information on each employee in the company, including their salary, departmental distribution within the company, years of experience, working hours, and attrition trends within the organisation.
